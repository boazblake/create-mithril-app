## Roadmap

Some ideas of where to go next:
* allow environment variables
* simplify integration with backend (already simple, but need to document how)
* support typescript (as a different template? or as a configuration option?)
* support JSX?
* make configuring multiple builds easier
* move less important stuff from README into separate documentation
* we don't need history fallback, should steer people towards hashbang
* should probably proxy from server to SPA instead

## Done
* open browser for user on dev mode?
* the demo app is making API calls to nowhere (fix it)
