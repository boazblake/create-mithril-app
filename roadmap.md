## Roadmap

Some ideas of where to go next:
* the demo app is making API calls to nowhere (fix it)
* simplify integration with backend
* support typescript (as a different template? or as a configuration option?)
* support JSX?
* make configuring multiple builds easier
* move less important stuff from README into separate documentation
