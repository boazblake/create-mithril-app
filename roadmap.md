## Roadmap

Some ideas of where to go next:
* simplify integration with backend (already simple, but need to document how)
* support typescript (as a different template? or as a configuration option?)
* support JSX?
* make configuring multiple builds easier
* move less important stuff from README into separate documentation
* we don't need history fallback, should steer people towards hashbang
* should probably proxy from server to SPA instead
* look into Rollup (Rollup still not suitable as of 2018-10-09, will check again)

## Done
* allow environment variables
* open browser for user on dev mode?
* the demo app is making API calls to nowhere (fix it)
* migrated to webpack 4
