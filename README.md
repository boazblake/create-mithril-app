# create-mithril-app - sets up a mithril project with webpack
[![npm package](https://nodei.co/npm/create-mithril-app.png?downloads=true&downloadRank=true&stars=true)](https://nodei.co/npm/create-mithril-app/)


This package is still under development, but we are very close to have a beta version.

## Purpose

It sets up a mithril.js project for you so you can start coding. The project comes with:
* webpack-dev-server
* hot reload
* webpack build


## Rationale

mithril.js is very hacker friendly because it can be referenced directly via CDN. But there are many advantages of working in a webpack environment, such as access to npm packages and code modularity. The purpose of this app is to make setting up a webpack project effortless.
